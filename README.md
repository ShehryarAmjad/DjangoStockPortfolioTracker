# DjangoStockPortfolio

Created a basic Stock-Portfolio Website using Django. For now its without a login/signup system, but in an version upgrade will add the authentication.<br/>
Django has inbuilt authentication and database systems.<p>
  
<h2>To run this on your system, follow the following steps:</h2><p>

* Step (1) -> Now we have to install the essential modules and a virtual enviroment in this directory to run our django project. If you have Pip installed previously, write the following command:
  *   ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      pip install virtualenv
      ```
* Step (2) -> Now we have to install django in your virtual enviroment. Firstly, write the following command to go into your virtual enviroment directory:
  *   ```
      cd venv
      ```
  *   Then write in your terminal:
      ```
      pip install django
      ```
* Step (3) -> Now we have everything installed. To run the virtual enviroment on your local host, come out of the _venv_ folder and into the _stocks_ folder and  write the following command:
  *   ```
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
* Step (4) -> If the above doesn't work, find the manger.py python file in your folder and run from that directory.
* Step (5) -> Go to the browser you use normally and type ***localhost:8000***. Yes it runs on that port.
* Step (6) -> To exit / close the localhost / server, go to your termainal and press ***CTRL + C***.
